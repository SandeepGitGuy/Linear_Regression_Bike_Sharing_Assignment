## Conclusions
- We were able to efficiently and accurately check if the data is clean and clean the data if required.
- We were able to Visualise the data to uncover patters and insights.
- We were able to reshape and prepare the data as best as possible to make the model predictions as efficient and accurate as possible.
- We were able to build a linear regression model by first using RFE(Recursive feature elimination) to get the number of variables down to manageable level and then manually removing variables untill best model is achieved.
- We were able to perform residual analysis on the train data to check if the model satisfies all the required conditions and validate the model.
- We were able to make predictions using the final model and get insights out of it. Finally the model is ready to predict the target variable value if the other variable values are fed to it.
